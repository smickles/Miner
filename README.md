The miner is a project which aims to efficiently collect resources from the
world and return them to a chest at the point of origin.

Some issue which miner expects to address include:
    * continued operation in the face of chunks unloading
    * selective gathering of valuable blocks
    * fuel management
    * transport of gathered resources to storage when finished or inventory is
        full
    * resumption of operation after handling a full inventory if task is
        unfinished
